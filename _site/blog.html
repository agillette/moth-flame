    <h2>Danielle wuz here</h2>
    <p><p>Dear world,</p>

<p>Danielle is writing a blog post for everyone to read. This is what she is writing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I am cool” -Danielle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She obviously has a lot of intelligent things to say.</p>

<p>In her time at FLM, she ate a wide variety of foods for lunch:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pizza</li>
  <li>pizza with pasta on it</li>
  <li>pizza with other stuff on it</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s all you need to know about Danielle.</p>

    <h2>Limericks are fun</h2>
    <p><blockquote>
  <p>If size and performance are key<br />
  And you’re happy with malloc and free,<br />
  If you’re one of the masses<br />
  Who disdain to write classes,<br />
  It’s time to start coding in C.<br /><br />
  Oh Java, I’m not being snarky,<br />
  But tell me, what is this malarky?<br />
  Thought my head would explode<br />
  When I looked at the code<br />
  And saw pages of class hier-ARCHy.<br /><br />
  I know an intelligent girl.<br />
  On the keyboard her fingertips twirl.<br />
  Soon brackets and slashes<br />
  Meet dots bangs and hashes<br />
  As she writes her next program in Perl.<br /><br />
  They say, “JavaScript’s really quite good.”<br />
  That it’s functional under the hood.<br />
  That for every mistake<br />
  That’s too easy to make,<br />
  There’s a “good part” that’s misunderstood. <br /><br />
  It gave all our spirits a lift<br />
  When Apple unveiled a new gift.<br />
  With inferring of types<br />
  And bit too much hype<br />
  So launches the era of Swift.<br /><br />
  C++ for its time was quite neat<br />
  As a tool for the coding elite,<br />
  But I started to doubt<br />
  On the day I found out<br />
  That its templates are Turing complete.<br /><br />
  The mixing of content and code<br />
  Has proven a dangerous road.<br />
  And those who agree<br />
  All blame PHP<br />
  When pages take ages to load.<br /><br />
  It’s not universal as yet,<br />
  But everyone fancies .NET.<br />
  Since we all can agree<br />
  That it’s sharper than C.<br />
  For MS it’s the best you can get.<br /><br />
  If you’re looking to program .NET<br />
  F# is the language to get.<br />
  I once read about LINQ —<br />
  It’s quite useful I think,<br />
  Though the syntax I sometimes forget.<br /><br />
  We’re studying SQL<br />
  To save us from database Hell,<br />
  And when we speak we’ll<br />
  Pronounce it sequel.<br />
  (Though spelling it works as well.)<br /><br />
  Try making your website come alive<br />
  By learning some HTML5!<br />
  With new tags galore,<br />
  New effects and more,<br />
  The future is soon* to arrive!<br /><br />
  With all that a website entails<br />
  I thought I’d try Ruby on Rails.<br />
  The code, it all works,<br />
  But the folks were such jerks<br />
  I decided to hit the trails. <br /><br />
  Objective C, Objective C, <br />
  Without you, oh where would we be? <br />
  Your syntax is old <br />
  (Too verbose we’ve been told) <br />
  But as clear as a language can be.<br /></p>
