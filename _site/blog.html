    <h1>Will Virtual Reality Win the Attention War for Screen Time?</h1>
    <p><div>
	<h2>Music is in danger of becoming a second screen activity, and for many people, passive listening already is.</h2>
	<h3><strong>Here’s a fun little experiment</strong> to try this Sunday while you’re watching the football game — show people in your party the ad below, for Microsoft’s new virtual reality / augmented reality partnership with the NFL, and make note of their reactions.</h3>
		<p>Depending on demographics, you’re likely to either get something along the lines of “that’s so cool” or some sort of outrage about wearing a screen while in the same room as others, and how that’s destroying everything.</p>
		<p >One of the biggest wars in tech is not Uber versus cab drivers, or Airbnb versus hotels, or, God help us, some artists versus streaming services. It’s the war over screen time, and it’s going to have huge implications not just for artists, but for everyone who consumes and enjoys content.</p>
	<h3>When I was a kid, the screen argument was that watching TV during dinner was destroying the American family.</h3>
		<p>It seems so cute and quaint now, especially when I talk to parents whose kids consider watching TV with them a punishment rather than a treat. Vast chunks of my generation grew up watching the box while we ate dinner, and we seem to have survived mostly intact. Now the big panic seems to be over smartphone screens, and why these youths can’t just put down the phones for a minute and listen to what a wise person writing an essay about “the kids” has to say.</p>
		<p>Last year I read a blog post by a prominent VC who railed against millennials using their phones at the table — and I should point out that this VC has made piles of money investing in the apps that make our phones so addictive and pretty much lives the “sell the disease, sell the cure” mentality. Now, he wasn’t talking about people who do legitimately dangerous things like texting and driving, or even potentially harmful and generally annoying things like staring at a phone in the middle of a crowded sidewalk. He was talking about people he was with at dinner who didn’t pay rapt attention to him when he spoke, because there was something more interesting on their phones and despite that, they should have been paying attention to him.</p>
		<p>We also get the semi-annual op-ed from a college professor who has banned laptops in the classroom and is extremely proud of that, because the fact that you have to force people to pay attention to you demonstrates that you’re super awesome at your job. First off, I went to school before the rise of the connected laptop, and with apologies to my teachers, I spent tons of time tuning them out the old fashioned way — doodling, writing terrible poetry, and daydreaming. But the real paradigm shift that VCs and professors are afraid of is this — just because you happen to be in a position of <img class="align-middle" src="http://mothandflamevr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Will-Virtual-Reality-Win-the-Screen-Attention-War.jpeg" alt="Will Virtual Reality Win the Screen Attention War." width="404" height="284"/>authority doesn’t now automatically mean people have to listen to and engage with you. There are other options, and for some people that is terrifying.</p>
		<p>Leading back to music, this means the bar has been substantially raised for artists and will go even higher once more people have access to VR and AR headsets. Until about ten years ago, if you were stuck at a boring show, there wasn’t much you could do, although I do have some memories of playing Tetris on a flip phone to pass the time during a dull opener. But now, if there’s a lull in the action, I can just whip out my phone and check Twitter, or read the news, or send a message to someone — and the band has to do much more to get my attention back. In a way, music is in danger of becoming a second screen activity, and for many people, passive listening already is. Rather than focusing on a song, it’s something that runs in the background while we consume other content.</p>
		<p>Some artists, especially younger electronic artists, have figured out a way to create a compelling experience that people want to participate in as well as socialize, so they don’t feel disconnected in the moment. Other artists struggle with this — I’ve hit a point where I can’t watch four dudes with guitars on stage unless they are really, really great. So unless they want to be relegated to background noise, they better think of something quick.</p>
	<h3>As virtual reality and augmented reality become more mainstream, I guarantee we’re going to see an acceleration of this, and that my generation, the ones glued to their phones, will be complaining that the damn kids never take their headsets off.</h3>
		<p>But for artists, this means that people can consume as they please and have endless options, and competition will be stiffer than ever. If you want to see live music, you’re no longer limited to what’s playing down the block — you can drop into any concert in the world via VR, and that will make it harder for the average band to draw an audience.</p>
		<p>I saw a tweet a while ago that said something to the effect of “Millennials don’t have short attention spans, there is just unlimited great content to consume.” Millennials have also figured out that outside of specific work and school related tests, there’s no final exam in culture and socializing — so if you miss a granular detail of a friend’s breakup story or a plot point in a TV show, no big deal. You likely discovered something else and it winds up being a wash.</p>
		<p>But for people who want others to pay attention to them, this means the bar has been raised dramatically. The correct response would be to create more compelling content that people will actually want to engage with — but that’s hard. Look for another round of screen wars to heat up, and start preparing those “Are Oculus headsets at the dinner table destroying our families” thinkpieces now.</p>

    <h1>Will Virtual Reality Be the New Normal in 2016?</h1>
    <p><div><h2>The long-awaited arrival of VR could change the way we consume content forever.</h2>
<h3><strong >Here’s a scene I predict</strong> will happen a year from now — on Christmas morning, teenagers across the world will roll out of bed, pick up their crutches, and hobble down to the tree.</h3>
<p>They’ll open a box to find a pair of virtual reality goggles and embrace their parents, forgiving them for buying them the hoverboard that caught fire and burned off their toes last year. The run on VR goggles will make Tickle Me Elmo look like a flop. It’ll make Frozen look lukewarm. It will become the new normal and change the way we consume content forever.</p>
<p>Virtual reality has been the next big thing for a really, really long time now. I was in middle school in 1993 when Lisa Simpson used VR goggles in “Marge vs. the Monorail.” They’ve been a perennial “any-minute-now” breakthrough, but all the technical and social pieces never quite lined up. Until the late 2000s, the thought of spending all your time with your face in a screen seemed kind of off — now we take it for granted that it’s the new way of life. Gaming has evolved in such a way it almost realistic and can be properly enjoyed with a VR headset. We have the tools to tell interactive stories and spend time immersed in situations — the New York Times did some groundbreaking work with Google Cardboard earlier this year.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l1_bp8YKUPU" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center></p>
<p>I’ve used both the Oculus Rift and Cardboard — I preferred the Oculus, but that’s probably because I used the free version of Cardboard that came with the Times. I actually don’t have a prediction about which device will win in the end, or maybe we’ll have an iOS/Android type of situation with a few devices — it really doesn’t matter. Either way, the price will probably fall enough and there will be sufficient content for people to want to start buying VR goggles very soon.<img class="align-middle" src="http://mothandflamevr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Will-Virtual-Reality-Occulus-Be-the-New-Normal.jpeg" alt="Virtual Reality Occulus" width="568" height="320" /></p>
<h3>So what does this mean for the music business?</h3>
<p>If played right, this could be a huge revenue opportunity, and a few companies, like Vantage.tv and Jaunt, seem poised to lead the way. A handful of artists have already released VR content, but they tend to be older and more established, like Paul McCartney and the Who. As the barrier to entry lowers, there are a number of ways artists and the music business as a whole could jump on the VR bandwagon.</p>
<p>First, you could spend a day in the life of an artist. This will no doubt benefit big artists the most, because who wouldn’t want to spend a day as Taylor Swift or Rihanna? Any in-app commerce opportunities could be massive, and the brand plays alone could be worth millions. But small artists with interesting stories could do something with this as well. There are plenty of world music artists who could create a day in the life experience and show others what it’s like to be an artist in Mali or Lagos or Jeddah, and domestic artists could offer a hipster’s tour of Brooklyn or Berlin.</p>
<p>Music education is obviously another huge area of opportunity, and talented artists could make a pretty penny giving lessons to students around the world. Many are already doing it via YouTube or Periscope, but teaching music in VR allows for more interaction and real time learning. This is an especially huge benefit for kids in rural markets or those who want to learn uncommon instruments.</p>
<h3><img class="align-middle" src="http://mothandflamevr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/VR-Headset-Google-Cardboard.jpeg" alt="VR Headset Google Cardboard" width="498" height="317" srcset="http://mothandflamevr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/VR-Headset-Google-Cardboard.jpeg 800w, http://mothandflamevr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/VR-Headset-Google-Cardboard-300x191.jpeg 300w, http://mothandflamevr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/VR-Headset-Google-Cardboard-768x489.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" />And then we come to the live space, where VR could expand the market in a massive way.</h3>
<p>I’ve stumped for more live-streaming for a long time and will continue to do so, but maybe the market will just skip right over it and go to watching concerts on a headset. This technology already exists, and people I know that have tried it out give it high marks for being realistic. Will it ever be exactly the same as a live show? Of course not — I saw Sleater-Kinney a few nights ago and watching them and singing along with my friends is an experience that can’t be replicated. But there are plenty of bands I like enough to pay $15 to watch on a headset that I wouldn’t pay $30 or more to see in real life. And there are huge numbers of people who don’t have access to many live shows now that would love to throw in some extra money to see something rather than nothing.</p>
<p>Once you start thinking about it, the number of paths artists can go down in the virtual world seems endless. They can allow fans to play games with them, something they should be doing on Twitch already. They can release interactive videos and even create games so that fans can be completely immersed in a concept. They can release stems and have fans create virtual collaborations, then release the best ones. And on, and on.</p>
<p>Virtual reality goggles will likely follow the same path as the iPhone — something that a handful of people get at first, and over a<img class="align-middle" src="http://mothandflamevr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Playstation-VR-Headset.jpeg" alt="Playstation VR Headset" width="308" height="206" srcset="http://mothandflamevr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Playstation-VR-Headset.jpeg 800w, http://mothandflamevr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Playstation-VR-Headset-300x201.jpeg 300w, http://mothandflamevr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Playstation-VR-Headset-768x514.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px" /> short period of time, becomes the norm for the way we consume content. Many startups wouldn’t exist without smartphones (“get a car service, right from your laptop” doesn’t pack quite the same punch) and VR will probably create a ton of new products and opportunities. Artists and labels should start planning their strategies now, so that come Christmas 2016, they’ll be prepared to be part of the hottest product launch in years.</p>

    <h1>Will Streaming Services Embrace VR to Move Forward?</h1>
    <p><div>
  <h2><strong>A few days ago,</strong> streaming service <a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/vr" target="_blank">Rhapsody </a>announced it was launching a VR app, with the initial content consisting mostly of performances shot at SXSW.</h2>
  <p>The quality of the performances is fairly solid, and while the requirement that all videos be downloaded before being played means that live-streaming shows in the app is still not possible, it’s certainly a pleasant diversion and value add to be able to watch some shows and see what new artists might be like live.</p>
  <p>But while this venture feels like a fun experiment, it also leads to much bigger questions — namely, is<img class="align-middle" src="http://mothandflamevr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rhapsody_VR_app-1024x761.jpeg" alt="Rhapsody VR app" width="439" height="326" align="middle" /> embracing Virtual Reality the future of music streaming services? And if services get into the VR game, what does that mean for artists who planned on building and monetizing their own VR content? Can streaming help bring VR to the masses, just like it brought, well, <em>streaming </em>to the masses?</p>
  <p>There have been several calls for streaming services to expand their content offerings beyond music, and to this point, a handful have listened and diversified. Tidal, Apple Music, and Spotify have all announced the launch of original programming, and all feature video in some capacity or another. Spotify also features clips from shows like the Tonight Show and the Daily Show, although the value add in this case remains unclear, as most of the same clips are widely available elsewhere. But in an age where the vast majority of streaming services feature the same catalog and price point, video allows them to differentiate without going down the annoying road of exclusive album premieres, a strategy that seems to backfire when you look at the numbers of illegal downloads that generally accompany each gated release.</p>
  <h3><span><em>Owning ears is great, but owning eyes and ears is where things start to get very interesting&#8221;.</em></span></h3>
  <p>While consumers have demonstrated a general unwillingness to join multiple music streaming services, they are more likely to belong to multiple video-streaming services. If there is enough different content, and enough of that content is compelling enough to users, then they’ll shell out for video. This is where streaming services can win with VR — if each has enough unique and interesting experiences, then it will make sense for users to pay up.</p>
  <p>Of course, getting artists to create that much content and put it inside a streaming service will be tricky, to say the least. An initial investment in recording equipment could bring costs down for artists who wanted to record and distribute concerts in VR — today, it’s still an expensive proposition, although costs are falling. Your average indie band or venue is unlikely to be able to record and distribute a show in VR, and streaming services could open up this opportunity for the masses. The problem comes when those experiences have to live inside the streaming service — artists won’t be able to charge extra fees to watch them. For newer artists, this could work out anyway; if someone finds you on Spotify’s “Discover in VR” playlist, decides you’re worth seeing live, and shells out for tickets the next time you’re in town, that could be a positive. But for bigger artists whose live concerts could be pay-per-view events, this would almost surely represent a loss. And if we’ve learned one thing in the last few years, it’s that services without mainstream content have a very hard time scaling.</p>
  <p>And all of this presupposes that other services won’t jump into the world of Virtual Reality and music, either. There’s nothing stopping <a href="http://www.popsci.com/netflix-vr-vs-hulu-vr" target="_blank">Netflix or Hulu</a> from launching their own VR verticals that include music, or MTV adding it to its recent spate of pivots back to the nineties. They’re already relaunching Unplugged; why not relaunch it in VR as well for good measure? Even these options offer an incomplete picture of what the future could look like — I’d put money on a decent number of smart people being hard at work on the Netflix of VR as I write this.</p>
  <h3 >Let’s suppose none of the events outlined above happen, and the lane is wide open for existing streaming services to jump into VR.</h3>
  <p>These services have already done an admirable job bringing what was arguably a new technology to a more mainstream audience, and while streaming numbers certainly don’t indicate everyone is using them, a growing number of people are. Of course, <a href="http://mothandflamevr.com/blog/will-virtual-reality-win-screen-time-war" target="_blank">listening to music on a portable device</a> via headphones is something people have been comfortable with for decades, while strapping a thing to your head and pretending to be a concert is still very new and has a higher learning and adoption curve — but so did the old Sony Walkman, back in the day (which incidentally also required you to strap something to your head.) If streaming services were to partner with headset manufacturers and get the technology to all of their subscribers, it could do wonders for the adoption rates of VR.</p>
  <p>Despite some potential downsides, it’s worth it for streaming services to follow in Rhapsody’s footsteps and at least start building out VR programs. The technology is ascendant and new enough where an experiment makes sense, and if it doesn’t work, it can be chalked up to an interesting learning experience. <a href="http://mothandflamevr.com/blog/virtual-reality-new-normal-2016" target="_blank">VR content </a>will almost certainly move toward the mainstream, and streaming services should act in favor of being too early rather than having to play catch-up. Owning ears is great, but owning eyes and ears is where things start to get very interesting.</p>
