> If size and performance are key<br>
  And you’re happy with malloc and free,<br>
  If you’re one of the masses<br>
  Who disdain to write classes,<br>
  It’s time to start coding in C.<br><br>
  Oh Java, I’m not being snarky,<br>
  But tell me, what is this malarky?<br>
  Thought my head would explode<br>
  When I looked at the code<br>
  And saw pages of class hier-ARCHy.<br><br>
  I know an intelligent girl.<br>
  On the keyboard her fingertips twirl.<br>
  Soon brackets and slashes<br>
  Meet dots bangs and hashes<br>
  As she writes her next program in Perl.<br><br>
  They say, “JavaScript’s really quite good.”<br>
  That it’s functional under the hood.<br>
  That for every mistake<br>
  That’s too easy to make,<br>
  There’s a “good part” that’s misunderstood. <br><br>
  It gave all our spirits a lift<br>
  When Apple unveiled a new gift.<br>
  With inferring of types<br>
  And bit too much hype<br>
  So launches the era of Swift.<br><br>
  C++ for its time was quite neat<br>
  As a tool for the coding elite,<br>
  But I started to doubt<br>
  On the day I found out<br>
  That its templates are Turing complete.<br><br>
  The mixing of content and code<br>
  Has proven a dangerous road.<br>
  And those who agree<br>
  All blame PHP<br>
  When pages take ages to load.<br><br>
  It’s not universal as yet,<br>
  But everyone fancies .NET.<br>
  Since we all can agree<br>
  That it’s sharper than C.<br>
  For MS it’s the best you can get.<br><br>
  If you’re looking to program .NET<br>
  F# is the language to get.<br>
  I once read about LINQ —<br>
  It’s quite useful I think,<br>
  Though the syntax I sometimes forget.<br><br>
  We’re studying SQL<br>
  To save us from database Hell,<br>
  And when we speak we’ll<br>
  Pronounce it sequel.<br>
  (Though spelling it works as well.)<br><br>
  Try making your website come alive<br>
  By learning some HTML5!<br>
  With new tags galore,<br>
  New effects and more,<br>
  The future is soon* to arrive!<br><br>
  With all that a website entails<br>
  I thought I’d try Ruby on Rails.<br>
  The code, it all works,<br>
  But the folks were such jerks<br>
  I decided to hit the trails. <br><br>
  Objective C, Objective C, <br>
  Without you, oh where would we be? <br>
  Your syntax is old <br>
  (Too verbose we’ve been told) <br>
  But as clear as a language can be.<br>
